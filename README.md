# Bao Bao's Bakery Quest

Welcome to Bao Bao‚Äôs Bakery Quest ‚Äì a fun and engaging cafe loyalty program!

## Concept

## How It Works

- **Scan & Earn:** Earn Golden Pastry Points with every purchase.
- **Level Up:** Begin as a "Pastry Apprentice" and progress to higher tiers.
- **Mini Games:** Play in-app games (e.g., catch flying pastries or mix ingredients) for bonus rewards.
- **Bao Bao Surprises:** Receive tips, encouragement, or surprise gifts from Bao Bao.
